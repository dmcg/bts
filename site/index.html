<p>Between July and October 2016 I worked for <a href="http://www.beyondthestory.com">Beyond the Story Ltd</a>. One of my invoices was paid, two remain unpaid.
</p>
<p>
After 2 months of broken promises to pay, I presented a Statutory Demand for the money. When I tried to take this demand to the County Court I was threatened with an injunction by <a href="http://www.weightmans.com/our-people/m/michael-green/">their lawyer</a>. He did not dispute the debt, but complained that the Statutory Demand was served personally on the managing director not at their registered office, but in the next door office.
</p>
<p>
Neither Beyond the Story Ltd nor their lawyer dispute the debt - I have a signed undertaking to pay the amount total plus interest, by the end of January. Despite this I have not received the money, and they continue to trade.
