<p>Between July and October 2015 I worked for <a href="http://www.beyondthestory.com">Beyond the Story Ltd</a>. Whilst all my invoices were paid, albeit 5 months late, one of my colleagues has not been paid as of today, 4 May 2016.

<p>
Beyond the Story Ltd does not dispute the debt to him - he has a signed undertaking to pay the amount total plus interest, by the end of January. Despite this he has not received his money, and they continue to trade. He wishes to remain anonymous because he fears that publicity will result in never being paid. I am lucky enough to only risk another cease-and-desist letter from their lawyers.
